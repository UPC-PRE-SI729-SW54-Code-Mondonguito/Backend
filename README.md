# Parking Now - Backend

## Summary
This project is the backend of the PARKINGNOW app which is developed using Spring Boot (Java), with a relational SQL database to manage parking data and user information.
The platform was made to help the drivers from cities to find a parking space and reduce the traffic in big cities such as Lima, Peru, and help the owners of the Parking lots to manage their business in an efficient way.
For this, we've designed the backend to give functionality to the app.
